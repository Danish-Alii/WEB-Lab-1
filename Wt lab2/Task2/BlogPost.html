				Fort Myers, Florida (CNN) - Democrats in Florida and Georgia are trying to make history on Election Day. Four days out, they are getting a boost from someone who knows a thing or two about it.

Former President Barack Obama will campaign for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Miami on Friday afternoon, at a rally also featuring incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, before heading a few hours north to Atlanta to meet up with former state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams. Gillum could become Florida's first African-American governor with a victory next week. Abrams' election would make her the first ever female African-American governor in the country.

Victory for both, as President Donald Trump's itinerary makes clear, would come as a stinging personal and political rebuke. Both Republican gubernatorial nominees, former Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, have clung tight to the President, who has taken an obvious interest in both races and lobbed insults at Gillum and Abrams.

Trump headlined a rally for the Florida Republican ticket, including DeSantis and Gov. Rick Scott, who is challenging Nelson, on Wednesday night in Fort Myers. He plans to return to the state this weekend. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for Kemp on Thursday in Georgia, and Trump will visit the state on Sunday.</p>

				(CNN) - Program notes: Watch CNN's Special Report "Democracy in Peril: The War on Voting Rights" Friday, November 2 at 11 p.m. ET.

Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has been called many things.

"A tireless champion for voter security," President Donald Trump once praised.

"The architect of voter suppression nationwide," and "vote suppressor in chief," critics Ari Berman, an author, and Jason Kander, a politician, have warned.

"The ACLU's worst nightmare," an announcer declared at the start of each episode of Kobach's former talk radio show.

When we sat down with Kobach in his Topeka office for a rare interview, we learned he is some of those things and more -- a zealot who believes voter fraud exists and it is his mission to stop it. He is a preacher to the converted. He refuses to acknowledge well-established evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare -- that, for example, stealing someone's identity to vote is less likely than being struck by lightning, as the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law put it.</p>

			<h4>Article 3</h4>

				Santa Clarita, California (CNN) - Donald Trump's presidency has sparked revolt among large swaths of young Americans.

But as Election Day draws near, a question looms: Will they vote?

Typical midterm elections tend to draw out an older, whiter electorate and fewer single women than presidential years. But because of the deep disdain for Trump among the younger generation, this midterm cycle appears supercharged by younger voters who were stung by the outcome in 2016, and cognizant that their generation could have made the difference for Hillary Clinton.

Strong turnout within that age group could tip some of the closer House races into the Democratic column.

There's "an embarrassment that comes with having not voted, or having not cared about voting in the past," said Jessica Cohen, a 30-year-old product manager for a software company in California.

"(People) are realizing how many consequences there have been since 2016," she added.

"That apathy has gotten us into some serious trouble."

New polling this week confirms that the energy among youth voters on the ground isn't a mirage.

A new poll from Harvard Institute of Politics this week found that 18-to-29-year-olds are far more likely to vote in Tuesday's midterm election than they were in 2010 and 2014. Forty percent of those polled said they would "definitely vote" in the midterms.</p>
